# NLP_Repository
This repository is my comprehensive collection of tools, resources, projects and projects' documentations related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and it serves as my portfolio for NLP.

# Key_Features
1. Text Data Preprocessing (Tokenization, Word embeddings & representations,...e.t.c.)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (on Text Data)
3. Use of Pre-trained models for NLP Tasks
4. NLP Algorithms and Models
5. Tutorial Notebooks

# Task_Statement
For each and every task in this repository, a document (Task statement) is given that shares important details, required libraries, Task requirements and Link to Datasets for the Task. This will be helpful for reproducibility of the task, if you want to reproduce it.

# Datasets
Datasets used for different tasks are either public or created. For public datasets, links are given in task statement. For created datasets they are placed in dataset folder.
